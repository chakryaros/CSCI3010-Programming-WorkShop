    // 1) Instantiate another Tree object here

    Tree ask;



    // 2) Call get_number_trees() from your tree object instantiated at #1


    // 3) Test to see whether pointers to your two Tree objects are equal.


    // 4) Call Seed() from the Tree object oak and Seed() from the Tree object instantiated at #1
    // Does changing the value of number_trees_ from one tree object affect what you see from the
    // other Tree object by calling get_number_trees()?


    // 5) Add a subclass of the Tree object. Your subclass should overwrite the Seed() method
    // when your subclass uses Seed(), the number_trees_ should increase by two. Write adequate code
    // to experiment how the static field changes when calling Seed() with your regular Trees versus with the
    // derived class that you implemented. Don't forget the keyword virtual!
    Shrubbery shrub;
    shrub.seed();
    std::cout << "Number of trees: " << oak.get_number_trees() << std::endl;


    // 6) Add a public static variable to your Tree class that counts how many Trees have been instantiated.
    // Can you access this via a Tree instance? Can you access it without an instance of Tree?
    // e.g.
    //std::cout << Tree::variable_name << std::endl;
    //std::cout << instance.variable_name << std::endl;
