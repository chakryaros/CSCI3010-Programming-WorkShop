Part 1 (bash + file navigation)
------------------------------
For all of the following questions, copy and paste the terminal commands that you use to acheive them into this file.

1. Create a directory called "lec5_directory".

mkdir lec5_directory/

2. Change directories into lec5_directory.

cd lec5_directory

3. Create a file called "names.txt".

touch names.txt

4. Use `echo` and `>` and/or `>>` to write the names of you and your partner into the file names.txt.

echo "James Chakrya Tai" > names.txt

5. Create a copy of "names.txt" called "names2.txt".

cp names.txt names2.txt

6. Create a directory called lec5_subdirectory and create a directory within lec5_subdirectory called subsubbasement.

mkdir -p lec5_subdirectory/subsubbasement

7. Move to your subsubbasement directory.

cd lec5_subdirectory/subsubbasement

8. Find your full path.

pwd

9. Without changing directories, move names2.txt to the subsubbasement directory.

mv ../../names2.txt .

10. Move back to your lec5_directory.

cd ../../

11. Create a directory called thisissilly

mkdir thisissilly/

12. Using the `rm` command, remove the thisissilly directory

rm -r thisisislly

13. Run the following code:
for i in `seq 1 30`; do
	touch "$i.silly"
done;

14. List all files in your directory ending in .silly. Use a "*" wildcard with `ls`.

engr2-7-186-dhcp:silly mega$ ls *.silly
1.silly		12.silly	15.silly	18.silly	20.silly	23.silly	26.silly	29.silly	4.silly		7.silly
10.silly	13.silly	16.silly	19.silly	21.silly	24.silly	27.silly	3.silly		5.silly		8.silly
11.silly	14.silly	17.silly	2.silly		22.silly	25.silly	28.silly	30.silly	6.silly		9.silly

15. List all files in your directory between 10.silly and 19.silly (inclusive). Use `ls` with a "?" wildcard (matches 1 single character).

ls 1?.silly

16. Close this file (Really!), then move it into your lec5_directory using the `mv` command.

17. Use the `less` command and the `cat` command on this file. What are the differences?

less opens the file in a closable instance, cat prints the file inline

18. Change directories to the parent directory of lec5_directory.

19. What command will you use to zip up your lec5_directory and all files and subdirectories to produce lec5.zip? (Answer, then do this and turn your zip file in on moodle). You can use `unzip -l lec5.zip` to check the contents of your zip file.

zip -r lec5_directory.zip lec5_directory/
